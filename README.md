## Models

### Current Implementations

1. **Standard Screening Model** - Traditional signaling model
2. **Multi-dimensional Screening** - Screening on multiple worker attributes
3. **Dynamic Screening** - Time-varying screening mechanisms
4. **Network-based Screening** - Leveraging social networks for information
