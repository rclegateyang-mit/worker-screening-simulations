# Worker Screening Model Simulations

A comprehensive economic simulation framework for estimating novel worker screening models.

## Overview

This repository contains tools and simulations for analyzing worker screening mechanisms in labor markets. The project focuses on developing and testing novel screening models that can improve hiring efficiency and reduce information asymmetries between employers and potential employees.

## Features

- **Multi-agent simulation framework** for labor market dynamics
- **Novel screening model implementations** with various signal structures
- **Economic equilibrium analysis** tools
- **Statistical estimation methods** for model parameters
- **Visualization and reporting** capabilities
- **Reproducible research** workflows

```

## Models

### Current Implementations

1. **Standard Screening Model** - Traditional signaling model
2. **Multi-dimensional Screening** - Screening on multiple worker attributes
3. **Dynamic Screening** - Time-varying screening mechanisms
4. **Network-based Screening** - Leveraging social networks for information

### Model Features

- Configurable worker types and productivity distributions
- Flexible signal structures and costs
- Equilibrium computation algorithms
- Welfare analysis tools

## Research Areas

- **Information Asymmetry Reduction** - How screening affects information gaps
- **Efficiency Analysis** - Welfare implications of different screening mechanisms
- **Policy Implications** - Effects of regulations on screening behavior
- **Market Dynamics** - Long-term evolution of screening practices
